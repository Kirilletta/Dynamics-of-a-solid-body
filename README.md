# Rigid Body Dynamics with Variable Mass

This README provides a summary of the equations necessary for visualizing the dynamics of a rigid body with variable mass.  This is particularly relevant for scenarios involving rockets, spinning spacecraft with ejected components, or other systems where mass changes over time.

## Key Equations

The core equation governing the rotational motion of a rigid body with variable mass is:
dJ/dt + ω x Jω = M + Mᵣ


Where:

*   **J:** The inertia tensor (3x3 matrix).  This is time-dependent due to changing mass distribution.
*   **ω:** The angular velocity vector (3x1 matrix).
*   **M:** The external moment vector applied to the body (3x1 matrix).
*   **Mᵣ:** The moment due to reactive forces from mass ejection/addition (3x1 matrix).  This is crucial for variable-mass systems.

**Simplified Cases:**

For rotation around a fixed axis (e.g., the z-axis), the equation simplifies to:
J(dωz/dt) = Mz + Mᵣz


Where:

*   `J` is the scalar moment of inertia around the z-axis.
*   `ωz` is the angular velocity around the z-axis.
*   `Mz` and `Mᵣz` are the z-components of the external and reactive moments, respectively.

**Example: Ring with Reactive Thrusters**

Consider a ring of radius *r* braking its rotation using two reactive thrusters.  The governing equation is:
(J₀ - qr²) * (dω/dt) = M - qu*r


Where:

*   `J₀`: Initial moment of inertia.
*   `q`: Mass flow rate of fuel.
*   `u`: Relative exhaust velocity.
*   `M`: External moment (often negligible).


## Visualization Considerations

To visualize the dynamics, you'll need to:

1.  **Numerical Integration:** Use numerical methods (e.g., Runge-Kutta) to solve the differential equations (either the full vector equation or the simplified versions).
2.  **Inertia Tensor Calculation:**  Implement a method to calculate the inertia tensor `J` at each time step, considering the changing mass distribution.  This will require knowledge of the body's geometry and mass distribution.
3.  **Reactive Moment Calculation:** Model the reactive moment `Mᵣ` accurately. This depends on the specifics of the mass ejection/addition mechanism (e.g., rocket nozzle geometry and thrust, ejected particle momentum).
4.  **3D Rendering:** Use a 3D graphics library (e.g., OpenGL, Three.js) to render the rigid body's orientation and motion based on the calculated `ω` at each time step.

## Libraries and Tools

Consider using libraries like:

*   **NumPy (Python):** For numerical calculations and matrix operations.
*   **SciPy (Python):** For numerical integration.
*   **OpenGL or Three.js:** For 3D visualization.
